A repo containing files related to bringing Modus soils data into Microsoft PowerBI and visualizing it.

Many thanks to Kevin Saul who did a great job conceiving and assembling this project during the 
2022 Fixing the Soil Health Tech Stack Hackathon.

Please see "JSON to PowerBI Steps.docx" for some instructions on how to start with these pbix files
in PowerBI Desktop to interact with the data in `examples` in this repo.
