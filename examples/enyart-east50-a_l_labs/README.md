Example modus files:
--------------------

EnyartEast50/
-------------
Contains a single soil test for the field known as "Enyart East 50".  It includes the PDF file
originally given to the farmer, a hand-transcription of that file into Modus form, and 
a lab-generated Modus file from A&L Labs (which has much more information than the PDF did).  

For reference, it also has the PDF of the fertilizer recomendations, which includes a picture of 
where the individual soil samples came from on the field. 

Though it did not come with the original soil sample, the soil tester also manually created a shapefile
of the actual GPS coordinates where each numbered sample was taken, and this is included as well.

* result.pdf: original PDF of soil test results given to farmer
* hand-modus.xml: hand-transcribed Modus XML version of the PDF file.
* lab-modus.xml: lab-generated Modus XML for this soil test.
* locations-shp.zip: Zip of the shapefiles with the sample locations.
* fertilizer-recommendations.pdf: reference PDF given to farmer with fertilizer recommendations and image
  of a map where samples were taken in the field.
